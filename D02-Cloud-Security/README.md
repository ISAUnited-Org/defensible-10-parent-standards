# D02 – Cloud Security Architecture & Resilience

This folder contains the D02 parent standard for Cloud Security Architecture & Resilience.

Planned contents include:
- Parent standard document (e.g., ISAU-DS-CS-1000)
- Annexes or appendices for multi-cloud and hybrid architectures
- Supporting diagrams for cloud networking, identity, workload security, and resilience patterns

This domain focuses on architecting secure, resilient multi-cloud environments using defensible identity, workload, and network controls.
