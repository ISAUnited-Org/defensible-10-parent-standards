# ISAUnited Defensible 10 Standards  

## Parent Standards Repository

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains the official Parent Standards for the ISAUnited Defensible 10 Standards (D10S) program. These documents define the core security architecture and engineering requirements used across enterprise environments.

Parent Standards form the foundation for all future Sub-Standards, annex documents, evidence packs, engineering traceability materials, and other components within the D10S ecosystem.

This repository is intended for:
- Security architects and engineers
- ISAUnited contributors and task group members
- Practitioners implementing ISAUnited standards
- Reviewers, auditors, and researchers

## About the Defensible 10 Standards (D10S)

The Defensible 10 Standards are ISAUnited’s primary cybersecurity architecture and engineering standards. Each Parent Standard defines measurable, engineering-driven requirements that support defensible security-by-design.

The 10 Parent Standards are:

1. D01 – Network Security Architecture and Engineering  
2. D02 – Cloud Security Architecture and Resilience  
3. D03 – Compute, Platform, and Workload Security Architecture  
4. D04 – Application Security Architecture and Secure Development  
5. D05 – Data Security Architecture and Cryptographic Engineering  
6. D06 – Identity and Access Security Architecture  
7. D07 – Threat and Vulnerability Security Engineering  
8. D08 – Monitoring, Detection, and Incident Response Architecture  
9. D09 – Cryptography, Encryptio,n and Key Management  
10. D10 – DevSecOps and Secure SDLC Engineering  

Each Parent Standard is:
- Engineering-based
- Measurable and testable
- Architecturally defensible
- Aligned with NIST and ISO foundational standards
- Designed to flow down into future Sub-Standards

---

## Repository Structure

Each Parent Standard will contain:
- A Parent Standard document (PDF or Markdown)
- Supporting annex documents
- Evidence Pack (EP) information and tables
- Engineering Traceability Materials (ETM)
- Cross-domain mappings (where applicable)
- Version history and peer review metadata

Sub-Standards, once developed and approved, will be linked to their respective Parent Standard folders.

## Governance and Development Process

ISAUnited uses a formal Standards Development Organization (SDO) methodology that includes:
- Annual open season for new Sub-Standard submissions
- Peer review by the ISAUnited Technical Fellow Society
- Engineering-based verification and validation
- Version-controlled standards management through GitHub

This repository reflects the approved, authoritative versions of all Parent Standards.

## Contributing

ISAUnited is an open standards development organization, and we welcome participation from practitioners, researchers, educators, and industry professionals who want to contribute to the evolution of the Defensible 10 Standards.

While the final approval of changes is governed through ISAUnited’s formal standards process, community engagement is encouraged. You may participate by:

- Submitting suggestions or feedback through Issues  
- Proposing enhancements to Parent Standards  
- Participating in Sub-Standard development during the annual Open Season  
- Joining task groups to support drafting, research, or peer review  
- Providing technical input, use cases, or implementation examples
