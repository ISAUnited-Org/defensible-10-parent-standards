# D03 – Compute, Platform & Workload Security Architecture

This folder will contain the D03 parent standard for Compute, Platform & Workload Security Architecture.

Planned contents include:
- Parent standard document (e.g., ISAU-DS-CWS-1000)
- Annexes for VM, container, and serverless security
- Supporting diagrams showing workload isolation, runtime protection, and platform controls

This domain focuses on securing compute platforms and workloads across virtual machines, containers, and serverless environments.
