This folder will contain the D05 parent standard for Data Security Architecture.

Planned contents include:
- Parent standard document for data security (e.g., ISAU-DS-DS-1000 or updated ID)

This domain focuses on securing data at rest, in transit, and in use, including classification, access, and governance models.
