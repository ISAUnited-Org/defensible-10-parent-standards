# D06 – Identity & Access Security Architecture

This folder will contain the D06 parent standard for Identity & Access Security Architecture.

Planned contents include:
- Parent standard document (e.g., ISAU-DS-IAM-1000)
- Annexes for IAM, federation, SSO, PAM, and identity governance
- Diagrams for identity flows, trust boundaries, and access control models

This domain focuses on securing identities (human and machine) and enforcing defensible access control architectures.
